  <title>WaveEdit and Virtual Outputs</title>
  <meta name="description" content="This will be a short one. I just wanted to share a quick tip on how to use WaveEdit with virtual audio outputs, 
if case someone is bashing their head against the wall trying to figure out what is wrong with it.

Earlier I reported, that Audacity had some problems with recording virtual audio outputs. I tried to record 
WaveEdit output with it, using BlackHole 16ch, and it was not working. I was getting a blank recording. That was a bit strange, because 
I was able to record WaveEdit output with other applications, like SoX and ffplay.
BlackHole 16ch also worked flawlessly for all the other applications and use-cases I had. So, I was a bit puzzled, 
until I checked the multi-channel wave rendered by sox. It was channel 3 and channel 4, that had the actual audio data, Not 1 and 2, as one might expect.
Why does WaveEdit (or is it sox?) act like this is beyond my comprehension.
