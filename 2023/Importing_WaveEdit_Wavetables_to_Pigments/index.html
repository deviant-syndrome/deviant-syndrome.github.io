  <title>Importing WaveEdit Wavetables to Pigments</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Just a quick note on how to import wavetables from WaveEdit to Pigments
Pigments is an brilliant exhibit of what is now called a power synth-buzzword, I first encountered it in “Future Music” magazine  Much like Massive, 
it combines a pack of different synthesis techniques (engines), all streamlined into a single interface for you to mix and match. Both of aforementioned products
also sport an easy “drag-and-drop” modulation system, which is a great way to get started with sound design.

Pigments is a great synth, but it does not have a built-in wavetable editor. So, how about another 
weird audio-software-combo? I’m not sure if it is a good idea, but it is definitely a fun one. 
I think that WaveEdit was originally designed to be used with AudioMoth, or some
other audio hardware, but it is also a great tool for wavetable editing with a very appealing UI. 
More importantly, it has an integrated library of community-curated wavetables, which you can use as a starting point for your own designs,
or to approximate some of the classic digital synth sounds, like the ones from Waldorf Microwave or PPG Wave.

There is a tiny compatibility issue, though, probably related to wavetable resolution. If I save a wavetable in WaveEdit, and then try to import it to Pigments, the 
frames do not line up. The wavetable is still usable, but it is not exactly what I wanted. I think that the problem is that WaveEdit uses 64 frames per wavetable, while Pigments uses 512.
How do we make them align properly? Simple! Just make it 8x slower, e.g. apply the speed multiplier of 0.125 and you are good to go.

    <p>Just a quick note on how to import wavetables from <a href="https://www.waveeditonline.com/">WaveEdit</a> to <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/analog-classics/pigments">Pigments</a>
Pigments is an brilliant exhibit of what is now called a <em>power synth</em>-buzzword, I first encountered it in “Future Music” magazine  Much like <a href="https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/synths/massive/">Massive</a>, 
it combines a pack of different synthesis techniques (engines), all streamlined into a single interface for you to mix and match. Both of aforementioned products
also sport an easy “drag-and-drop” modulation system, which is a great way to get started with sound design.</p>

<p>Pigments is a great synth, but it does not have a built-in wavetable editor. So, how about another 
weird audio-software-combo? I’m not sure if it is a good idea, but it is definitely a fun one. 
I think that WaveEdit was originally designed to be used with <a href="https://www.openacousticdevices.info/">AudioMoth</a>, or some
other audio hardware, but it is also a great tool for wavetable editing with a very appealing UI. 
More importantly, it has an integrated library of community-curated wavetables, which you can use as a starting point for your own designs,
or to approximate some of the classic digital synth sounds, like the ones from <a href="https://waldorfmusic.com/en/microwave">Waldorf Microwave</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPG_Wave">PPG Wave</a>.</p>

<p>There is a tiny compatibility issue, though, probably related to wavetable resolution. If I save a wavetable in WaveEdit, and then try to import it to Pigments, the 
frames do not line up. The wavetable is still usable, but it is not exactly what I wanted. I think that the problem is that WaveEdit uses 64 frames per wavetable, while Pigments uses 512.
How do we make them align properly? Simple! Just make it 8x slower, e.g. apply the speed multiplier of 0.125 and you are good to go.</p>
